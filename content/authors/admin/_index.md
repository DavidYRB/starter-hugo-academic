I am working at Staples Inc. as a software engineer in Boston, Massachusetts. My career goal is to become a roboticist who is not only devoted to explore the frontier of the area but also focusing on how to convert research output from lab to real life. More importantly, I would like to advocate for this area and inspire more people to involved in this area.

In the past few years, I was fortunate to work on different robotics projects, from design, fabrication and control a modularized soft robot, to application development of different types of mobile robots and robot manipulator. Those experience in both academia and industry provide me wide understanding of how robotics as a discipline stands in our life and guides me to pursue in a direction more aligned with my career goal.
