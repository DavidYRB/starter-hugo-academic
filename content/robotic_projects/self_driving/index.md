- Developed a PID controller and a MPC controller  to drive a vehicle in a simulator track (Control) 
- Programmed a particle filter to localize a vehicle with sensor information with RSME less than 0.4 (Localization) 
- Created an Extended Kalman Filter fusing Radar and Lidar data to estimate pedestrianâ€™s position with RSME less than 0.1 (Sensor Fusion) 
- Generated a dataset of vehicles (featuring by spatial binning color, color histogram, and histogram of gradient (HOG)) and used LinearSVC to train a car classifier acquired 98.3% accuracy (Machine Learning) 
- Detected lane lines and marked driving area with polynomial-fit boundary in video with sobel threshold and color threshold binary images from each frame (Computer Vision) 
- Trained a traffic sign classifier (LeNet) with preprocessed 43-class (50,000+ images) on AWS with validation accuracy with 94.3% and test accuracy 94% (Deep Learning) 
- Controlled a vehicle to drive within a track by a model (LeNet) which is trained with collected dataset of human drive (Deep Learning)
